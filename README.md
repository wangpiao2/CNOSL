可读且准确的开源协议中文翻译企划 | A Project on Readable and Accurate Open-source License Translation in Chinese.
------------

As currently presented, existing Chinese translations of various open-source licenses are really difficult to read, even if I speak Chinee Mandarin and I'm qualified PRC lawyer. Also, from the perspective of a legal professional, current Chinese texts of many licenses contains numerous mistakes and ambiguiities.  

Therefore, I initiated this Project, to provided professional and tailored  translation of open-source licenses so that developers, lawyers and individuals who share interests in open-source and intellecual property rights could obtain usable materials for their study and research.

I intend to start this Project with the translation of [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). I believe understanding GPL throughly will open the gate of understanding the open-source world. After completion of my Chinese version of GPL License, I'll continue to translate other free software licenses and open-source licenses. All translations will be updated on the [wiki page](https://github.com/ireia/CNOSL/wiki) of this repository, and .docx file will also be provided in this page.

I provide online review on the [wiki page](https://github.com/ireia/CNOSL/wiki) of this repository and .docx file for your convenience.
